# NixOS Dots
My NixOS Dotfiles for my laptop and desktop. System modules are in /modules, and home modules in /home-manager. System modules have two collections, common and common-desktop. Common is for all machines, common-desktop is for only machines with a DE. Currently I only have desktops here, but I may add servers in the future.
